PROJECT TITLE: Gray-Scale

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of the project is to find the coldest day in the given day, month or year. 

VERSION or DATE: 24.06.2020

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
1) Download the zip file of the given folder.
2) Extract the folder to the required destination.
3) You can start the project by opening the folder through BlueJ. Once the Folder is opened, you can right click on the class and create an object for a given class (i.e. ColdestDay).
4) Once the object is created, right click on the object to to use the functions in the program.
5) If you have selected 'testColdestHourInFile', the application would ask you to select a file (I have provided you with a folder i.e. nc_weather, of dated csv files that contain the temperatures, humidity etc. of every hour of the given date).
6) Once you have selected the file, the application would give you the coldest temperature of the day.
7) If you have selected 'testFileWithColdestTemperature', the apllication would ask you to select a bunch of files.
8) Once you have selected a bunch of files, the application would give you coldest temperature within the various files selected.
9) Similarly, we have 'testLowestHumidityInFile' and 'testLowestHumidityInManyFiles' which tests for the lowest humidity in a single file or many files.
10) Similarly, we have 'testAverageTemperatureInFile' which finds the average temperature in the file.
11) Similarly, we have 'testAverageTemperatureWithHighHumidityInFile' which finds the average temperature with humidity higher than 80.
